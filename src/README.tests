alloc1.test: 

  This test is a simple sequence of memory allocation and should be
  the same whatever the allocation algorithm you use. It only aims at
  checking that the allocation mechanism works and does not need the free
  mechanism to be implemented.

alloc2.test:

  This test is the following of the previous one but frees the second
  and the fourth memory area. It aims at checking that your
  implementation of free is correct.

alloc3.test:

  This test is the following of the previous one and allocates two
  more chunks. The first fit strategy should get "fooled" by this
  allocation. Explain why.

alloc4.test:

  This test is similar to the previous one except for the size of the
  last tow chunks that differs. The best fit strategy should get
  "fooled" by this allocation. Explain why.

alloc5.test:

  This tests is meant to test that your free function merges
  contiguous free chunks of memory (no deferred coalescing!).

test_leak.test:

  This tests uses the LD_PRELOAD variable to replace the libc
  malloc,free, realloc by the one you defined in libmalloc.so. Then it
  runs the program leak_test.c which does recursive calls and
  leaks. You can easily check it using valgrind by hand (and without
  the LD_PRELOAD of course).

test_leak2.test:

  This tests keeps using the LD_PRELOAD variable to replace the libc
  malloc,free, realloc by the one you defined in libmalloc.so. Then it
  tests runs the program leak_test.c with a special argument which
  prevents it from leaking. Again, you can easily check this behavior
  using valgrind.
